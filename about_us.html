                        <p>
                            You and your families are very important and we’d like to invite you to Bethesda Community Church of
                            Antioch California. If you are not involved in a dynamic, life-giving, Bible-centered church, join us here! We
                            more than a church … we are a church family, and we would love  see you get connected.

                            <span class="fw-bold"><br/>Brief History of Bethesda Community Church</span>

                        
                        <p> 
                            To God be the glory for the great things He has done. After investing approximately14 years of active
                            ministering time in Independent Community Church in Richmond under the leadership of Pastor Tommie
                            Bradford. While in Richmond, along with his other assignments within the church, the Lord used Pastor
                            Johnson to start what is now known as Independent Prison Ministry. This is the group he led to establish church
                            services and bible studies in San Quentin State prison, San Francisco city jail, San Bruno city jail and in
                            Richmond city jail.  These activities kept him busy until he moved to Antioch California in 2001. The Lord
                            blessed us to move to the city of Antioch in December 2001.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Lord laid it on Pastor Johnson and Charity Ejomah’s heart to start a new work for
                            the kingdom of God while they were still in Richmond, but the accident that nearly took his wife and daughter’s
                            life the day after moving into their new home on December 9 th , put the plan on hold for a while. Note that
                            enemy may succeed in delaying your dream but he cannot delete it entirely. After a period of visiting a few
                            churches in the Antioch area, the pastor and his family decided to start Sunday morning fellowship in his living
                            room in July 2003. There we met Sunday after Sunday to worship the Lord. It gave the pastor an indescribable
                            opportunity of one on one to minister and teach his family for almost two years. Early in 2004, the pastor met
                            the Director of Antioch Press a man by the name Mr. Allen Payton who gave the church a much needed
                            publicity in his city wide news paper called “Antioch Press”.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In May 2004, the Lord enabled us to secure our 50(C) (3) which is the Federal tax exempt status with a
                            fully functioning Board of Directors. In 2007, we had to close the church doors when I mistakenly moved to
                            southern California and empowered an associate pastor to care for the flock of Jesus Christ. It was a terrible
                            error on my park. When we were forced to move back to northern California due to overwhelming
                            circumstances we experience spiritual homelessness. For 7 years, we went from church to church and ended up
                            spending about 4 years to assist Divine faith Ministry under the leadership of Pastor Matthias Esoimeme. Again,
                            after a period of prayers between Pastor Charles Cole and my-self under a shady tree in the city of Vallejo in
                            September 2014, the Lord gave us the second green light to re-launch the ministry in my living room in the city
                            of Antioch with my family and a few friends. God has been faithful to us and will continue to be by his mercies.

                            Bethesda Community Church is a Pentecostal non-denomination     whose roots are in Bethesda Gospel Mission,
                            Irri, Isoko LGA, Delta State, Nigeria. Archbishop Dr. Christian Apena is the spiritual father and mentor of this

                        <p class="fw-bold text-body-emphasis mb-1"><span class="church-welcome">The scripture is Inspired</span></p>
                        <p>
                            <span class="fw-bold">What We Believe And Teach</span><br/>
                            1. The Scriptures is Inspired. We believe the Bible to be the inspired, the only infallible, authoritative Word of
                            God revealing the love of God to the world. It is accurate, authoritative and applicable to our everyday lives. 1
                            Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Timothy 3:15-17; John 3:16. (II Timothy 3:15-17; II Peter 1:21).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2. The One True God. The triune Godhead consists of one true God the Father, Jesus Christ His Son, and the
                            Holy Ghost the third person of the Godhead (John 10:36; 14:26; 20:21-22). While we believe God manifested
                            HIMSELF in three persons, He is nevertheless ONE GOD.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            3. Lord Jesus Christ. We believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in
                            His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood, in His bodily resurrection, in His
                            ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His personal returning in power and glory (Isaiah 7:14;
                            Matthew 1:18, 23; Luke 1:34-35).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            4. Special Creation. We believe the triune God created the universe apart from pre-existing materials and
                            without any evolutionary process. We believe in the historicity of the first eleven chapters of Genesis (Genesis
                            1:1; Nehemiah 9:6; Psalms 102:25; Acts14:15).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            5. Satan. We believe that Satan was originally created a perfect being. He rebelled against God. As a result he
                            became depraved, the devil and adversary of God and His people, the leader of a host of angels who fell with
                            him. Satan has been judged and defeated at the cross and awaits his ultimate doom at the conclusion of the
                            Millennial Reign which takes place after the Second Advent of Jesus Christ (Ephesians 2:2; I Thessalonians 3:5;
                            I Peter 5:8; Revelation 12:9; 20:1-3; 7-10).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            6. The Fall of Man. Man was created good and upright; for God said, &quot;Let us make man in our image, after our
                            likeness!&quot; However, man by voluntary transgression fell and thereby incurred not only physical death but also
                            spiritual death, which is separation from God (Genesis 1:26-27; 2:17; 3:6; Romans 5:12-19).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            7. The Salvation of Man. Man&#39;s only hope of redemption is through the shed blood of Jesus Christ the Son of
                            God.
                            a. Conditions to Salvation. Salvation is received through repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord Jesus
                            Christ. By the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost, being justified by grace through faith,
                            man becomes an heir of God according to the hope of eternal life (Luke 24:47; John 3:3; Romans 10:13-15;
                            Ephesians 2:8; Titus 2:11, 3:5-7).

                            b. The Evidences of Salvation. The inward evidence of salvation is the direct witness of the Spirit (Romans
                            8:16). The outward evidence to all men is a life of righteousness and true holiness (Ephesians 4:24; Titus 2:12).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            8. Sanctification. 
                            a. Sanctification is an act of separation from that which is evil and of dedication unto God (Romans 12:1-2; I
                            Thessalonians 5:23; Hebrews 13:12).
                            b. Sanctification is obtainable as a second definite work of grace, received by faith in the blood of Christ.
                            c. Sanctification is realized in the believer by recognizing his identification with Christ in His death and
                            resurrection, and by faith reckoning daily upon the fact of that union, and by offering every faculty continually
                            to the dominion of the Holy Spirit (Romans 6:1-11,13; 8:1-2,13; Galatians 2:20; Philippians 2:12-13; I Peter
                            1:5).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            9. The Baptism in the Holy Ghost. All believers are entitled to, should ardently expect and earnestly seek the
                            promise of the Father, the baptism in the Holy Ghost and fire, according to the command of our Lord Jesus
                            Christ. The Bible evidence of the baptism in the Holy Ghost is witnessed by the physical sign of speaking with
                            other tongues as the Spirit of God gives utterance. (Acts 2:4; 10:46; 19:6). This was the normal experience of all
                            in the early Christian church. With it comes the enduement of power for life and service, the bestowment of the
                            gifts and their uses in the work of the ministry (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4; I Corinthians 12:1-31). With the baptism
                            in the Holy Ghost comes such experiences as an overflowing fullness of the Spirit (John 7:37-39; Acts 4:8), a
                            deepened reverence for God (Acts 2:42-43), and a more active love for Christ, for His Word, and for the lost
                            (Mark 16:20).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            10. The Ordinances and Practices of the Church. 
                            a. Baptism in Water. The ordinance of baptism by immersion in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of
                            the Holy Ghost is commanded in the Scriptures. All who repent and believe in Christ as Savior and Lord are to
                            be baptized by immersion. Thus they declare to the world that they died with Christ and that they also have
                            been raised with Him to walk in newness of life (Matthew 28:19; Mark 16:16; Acts 10:47-48; Romans 6:4). 
                            b. Holy Communion. The Lord&#39;s Supper, consisting of the elements - bread and fruit of the vine - is the symbol
                            expressing our sharing the divine nature of our Lord Jesus Christ (II Peter 1:4); a memorial of His suffering and
                            death (I Corinthians 11:26); and a prophecy of His second coming (I Corinthians 11:26); and is enjoined on all
                            believers &quot;until He comes!&quot;
                            c. Child Dedication. Since water baptism is an outward expression of an inward work of grace, we do not
                            practice infant baptism. However, we do encourage presenting our children to the Lord in child dedication and
                            blessing until they are old enough to make their own choice and decision (Luke 2:27; Mark 10:13-16).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            11. The Church and Her Mission. 

                            a. The Church is the Body (Bride) of Christ, the habitation of God through the Spirit, with divine appointment
                            for the fulfillment of her great commission. Each believer, born of the Spirit, is an integral part of the General
                            Assembly and Church of the Firstborn, which are written in heaven (Ephesians 1:22-23; 2:22; Hebrews 12:23).
                            b. Since God&#39;s purpose concerning man is to seek and to save that which is lost, to be worshipped by man, and
                            to build a body of believers in the image of His Son, the priority reason-for-being of BETHESDA
                            COMMUNITY CHURCH ARE:
                            (1) To be an agency of God for evangelizing the world (Acts 1:8; Matthew 28:19-20; Mark 16:15-16).
                            (2) To be a corporate body in which believers may worship God (I Corinthians 12:13).
                            (3) To be a channel of God&#39;s purpose to build a body of saints being perfected in the image of His Son
                            (Ephesians 4:11-16; I Corinthians 12:28; 14:12).
                            c. BETHESDA COMMUNITY CHURCH ARE exists expressly to give continuing emphasis to this reason-for-
                            being in the New Testament apostolic pattern by teaching and encouraging believers to be baptized in the Holy
                            Spirit. This experience:
                            (1) Enables them to evangelize in the power of the Spirit with accompanying supernatural signs (Mark 16:15-
                            20; Acts 4:29-31; Hebrews 2:3-4).
                            (2) Add a necessary dimension to worshipful relationship with God (I Corinthians 2:10-16; 12; 13; and 14).
                            (3) Enables them to respond to the full working of the Holy Spirit in expression of fruit and gifts and ministries
                            as in New Testament times for the edifying of the body of Christ (Galatians 5:22-26; I Corinthians 12:28; 14:12;
                            Ephesians 4:11-12; Colossians 1:29).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            12. The Ministry. A divinely called and scripturally ordained ministry has been provided by our Lord for the
                            threefold purpose of leading the Church in: (1) Evangelization of the world (Mark 16:15-20); (2) Worship of
                            God (John 4:23-24); (3) Building a body of saints being perfected in the image of His Son (Ephesians 4:11-16).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            13. Divine Healing. Divine healing is an integral part of the gospel. Deliverance from sickness is provided for
                            in the atonement and is the privilege of all believers (Isaiah 53:4-5; Matthew 8:16-17; James 5:14-16).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            14. The Blessed Hope. The resurrection of those who have fallen asleep in Christ and their translation together
                            with those who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord is the imminent and blessed hope of the
                            church (I Thessalonians 4:16-17; Romans 8:23; Titus 2:13; I Corinthians 15:51-52).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            15. The Millennial Reign of Christ. The Word of God promises the catching away of the prepared and waiting
                            saints, followed by the great tribulation, and then the return of our Lord with His saints and holy angels in
                            power and great glory to reign on earth a thousand years. This millennial reign will bring the salvation of
                            national Israel (Ezekiel 37:21-22; Zephaniah 3:19-20; Romans 11:26-27) and the establishment of universal
                            peace (Isaiah 11:6-9; Psalms 72:3-8; Micah 4:3-4).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            16. The Final Judgment. There will be a final judgment in which the wicked dead will be raised and judged
                            according to their works. Whosoever is not found written in the Book of Life, together with the devil and his
                            angels, and the beast and false prophet, will be consigned to everlasting punishment in the lake which burneth
                        </p>
